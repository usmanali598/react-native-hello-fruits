## React Native App

A basic Hello World demo of react native for android OS. I have tried with actual physical device.

## How to use
1. git clone url
2. cd directory
3. npm install
4. Connect physical or virtual device
5. Run command in same directory, 'react-native run-android'

If everything is fine in your case, you will find fruits and text on device screen.
